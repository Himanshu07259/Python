# About
This is a simple snake, water, gun game made in Python.
In this game, I have used two python modules, random and os.
I have used random to generate the choice(either snake, water or gun) of the computer and the os module to clear the screen at certain points.

How to play---

First, enter the number of rounds you want to play.
Then, enter any of the following - s for snake, w for water or g for gun.
After that, the bot will make his turn.
Next, you will see the result whether you won or not or the game is tie.
Then, Enter something to continue.

Another round will start if you have selected more than 1 round.

Next, the final or overall result will be printed and you will be asked whether you want to play the game again or not.

Enjoy the game!!!
